1. Agent-based ADMM: It is used to generate the column pool by solving a sample dataset. 
The study case only has pickup nodes with very tight pickup window, so we don't use state-transition rules.
In this case, the vehicle capacity can be used to record the vehicle carrying state.

2. Flow-based ADMM is used to solve the LP model where arc_to_agent and passenger_to_agent relation are generated internally.

3. Flow-based ADMM_version_2 puts the arc_to_agent and passenger_to_agent relation into external dictionaries, so it can solve this prolem faster.
